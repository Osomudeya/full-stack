# Memory Game Application Service Level Agreement (SLA)

## 1. Introduction

This Service Level Agreement (SLA) outlines the performance guarantees for the Memory Game application. It defines the service commitments, metrics used to measure service quality, and remedies for failing to meet these commitments.

## 2. Definitions

- **Service**: The Memory Game application, including frontend, backend APIs, and database.
- **Availability**: The percentage of time the service is operational and responding to requests successfully.
- **Latency**: The time it takes for the service to respond to a request.
- **Error Rate**: The percentage of requests that result in errors (HTTP 5xx status codes).
- **Measurement Period**: Calendar month, unless otherwise specified.
- **Maintenance Window**: Planned downtime for system maintenance and upgrades.
- **Critical Incident**: Any service disruption that affects all users of the application.

## 3. Service Commitments

### 3.1 Availability

| Tier | Availability Target | Maximum Allowed Downtime (per month) |
|------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Production | 99.5% | 3 hours, 36 minutes |
| Development | 99.0% | 7 hours, 12 minutes |

Availability is calculated using the following formula:

```
Availability = (Total Time - Downtime) / Total Time * 100%
```

Where:
- Total Time = Total minutes in the measurement period
- Downtime = Minutes during which the service is unavailable

### 3.2 Performance

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| API Response Time (p95) | < 500ms |
| API Response Time (p99) | < 1000ms |
| Frontend Loading Time | < 3 seconds |
| Error Rate | < 1% |

### 3.3 Data Retention

| Data Type | Retention Period |
|-----------|------------------|
| User Scores | Indefinitely |
| System Logs | 30 days |
| Metrics | 90 days |

## 4. Monitoring and Reporting

### 4.1 Monitoring

The following metrics are continuously monitored to ensure compliance with the SLA:

- **Request Rate**: Number of requests per second
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests
- **Latency**: Response time in milliseconds
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, disk, and network usage
- **Database Performance**: Query execution time
- **Availability**: Uptime percentage

### 4.2 Reporting

SLA performance reports will be generated monthly and include:

- Actual availability percentage
- Performance metrics distribution
- Error rate statistics
- Incident summary
- Compliance status with the SLA commitments

## 5. Incident Management

### 5.1 Incident Response Times

| Severity | Description | Response Time | Resolution Target |
|----------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Critical | Service unavailable for all users | 15 minutes | 2 hours |
| High | Major functionality affected | 30 minutes | 4 hours |
| Medium | Limited functionality affected | 2 hours | 12 hours |
| Low | Minor issues with minimal impact | 24 hours | 48 hours |

### 5.2 Incident Notification

Stakeholders will be notified of incidents through:

- Email
- Dashboard alerts
- Status page updates

## 6. Maintenance Windows

Planned maintenance activities will be:

- Scheduled during off-peak hours
- Announced at least 48 hours in advance
- Limited to 4 hours per month
- Excluded from availability calculations

## 7. Exclusions

The following are excluded from SLA calculations:

- Scheduled maintenance within announced windows
- Issues caused by client-side problems
- Force majeure events (natural disasters, etc.)
- Issues with third-party services outside our control

## 8. Remedies

If the service fails to meet the SLA commitments, the following remedies will apply:

| Availability | Credit |
|--------------|--------|
| < 99.5% but ≥ 99.0% | 10% credit |
| < 99.0% but ≥ 95.0% | 25% credit |
| < 95.0% | 50% credit |

## 9. Review and Adjustments

This SLA will be reviewed quarterly and may be adjusted based on:

- Historical performance data
- Changes in system architecture
- User requirements
- Industry standards
